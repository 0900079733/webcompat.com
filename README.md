=============

Source code for webcompat.com

Placeholder theme based on https://github.com/dbtek/dbyll.

For now this site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). See [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for how to install Jekyll.

Once installed, use `jekyll serve --watch` in the site root to build the site. You can then see it at http://localhost:4000 and it will rebuild itself after a file is changed.
