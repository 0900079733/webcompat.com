You are welcome to contribute to this project. Here are the guidelines we try to stick to in this project.

 * [Question or Problem?](#question-or-problem)
 * [Issues and Bugs](#filing-an-issue)
 * [Triaging Issues](#triaging-issues)
 * [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)
 * [Submission Guidelines](#submission-guidelines)
 * [Coding Style](#coding-style)
 * [Working Environment setup](#working-environment-setup)
 * [Installing Grunt](#installing-grunt)
 * [Running Tests](#running-tests)


## Question or Problem

If you have a question about the site or about web compatibility in general, feel free to join us in the #webcompat channel on the Mozilla IRC network. [Here's how to join](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC#Connect_to_the_Mozilla_IRC_server).

Otherwise, you can try to ping Mike Taylor on the Freenode network with the following command `/msg miketaylr hi I have a question about webcompat.com`.

## Filing an Issue

If you're using webcompat.com and something is confusing, broken, or you think it could be done in a better way, please let us know. Issues are how the project moves forward&mdash;let us know what's bothering you.

* Search the [issues
  list](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/issues)
  for existing similar issues.  Consider adding to an existing issue if you
  find one.
* Choose a descriptive title.
* Provide a test, snippet of code or screenshot that illustrates the problem. This small
  gesture goes a long way towards getting a speedy fix.

## Triaging Issues

One way to contribute is to triage issues. This could be as simple as confirming a bug, or as complicated as debugging errors and providing fixes. A tiny bit of effort in someone else's issue can go a long way.

## Feature Requests

You can request a new feature by [submitting an issue](#filing-an-issue) to our repo.  If you
would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first in an issue or irc so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent
duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the
project.
* **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted as a Pull Request.


## Submission Guidelines

All code contributions should come in the form of a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request), as a topic branch. You'll probably want to [set up a local development environment](#working-environment-setup) to get that far.

* Have a quick search through existing issues and pull requests so you don't waste any of your time.
* Make your changes in a new branch

	`git checkout -b name-of-fix-branch master`

* Create your patch; commit your changes

	`git commit -a`

* Push your branch to GitHub:

	`git push origin name-of-fix-branch`

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `webcompat.com:dev.webcompat.com`*.

To do this, click on the Edit button at the top of the Pull Request page.

![master](https://i.cloudup.com/tgBan6xVWt-2000x2000.png)

Select the `dev.webcompat.com` branch on the left hand side.

![change](https://i.cloudup.com/TZGd2ze3DL-2000x2000.png)

And you should be good to go.

![ready](https://i.cloudup.com/gE8awVDEyE-2000x2000.png)

* Continue discussion in the pull request.

After all that, if you'd like, you can add your name to our humans.txt file.

* `dev.webcompat.com` is our "development" branch where we can test, experiment, and deploy changes to dev.webcompat.com before merging into `master` and pushing to webcompat.com.

## Coding Style
It's still early days for this project, so there are no strict coding guidelines (yet?).

All Python code should pass [pep8](http://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/1.4.6/intro.html).

When in doubt, follow the conventions you see used in the source already.


## Working Environment setup

For testing code locally, you will need a very basic setup. There are a few requirements. These instructions have been made for working with Linux and MacOSX. If you install it successfully on Windows, we will appreciate a pull request on this documentation.

* Python 2.7
* node 0.10.0
* Github account with a fake repo

### Simple setup

@@to write simple doc that would be using the Makefile@@

### Detailed setup
#### Installing virtualenv

``` bash
# Install virtualenv
[sudo] pip install virtualenv
```

#### Installing Project source code

``` bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:webcompat/webcompat.com.git
# change to directory
cd webcompat.com
# set up virtual environment
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Installing Grunt

We use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as a task runner to perform certain things (minify + concat JS assets, for example). You need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) installed to be able to run Grunt. Once that's done, use `npm` to install the grunt dependencies. Version 0.10.0 or above is required.

First install the `grunt-cli` tool:

``` bash
[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli
[sudo] npm install
grunt
```

#### Configuring The Server

To test issue submission, you need to create a fake repo on github. Let's assume your username is `miketaylr`. Create a new repository called `nobody-look-at-this` (or the name of your choice).


``` bash
# set up config.py, filling in appropriate secrets and pointers to repos
cp config.py.example config.py
```

You can now edit `config.py` and

1. provide pointers to [repo issues URIs](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/blob/dev.webcompat.com/config.py.example#L40-L44). `ISSUES_REPO_URI = "<user>/<repo>/issues"`. With the example, we chose it would be `ISSUES_REPO_URI = "miketaylr/nobody-look-at-this/issues"`
2. [get the secrets](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/blob/dev.webcompat.com/config.py.example#L24-L38) for config.py


#### Starting The Server

``` bash
# start local server
python run.py
```

You should now have a local instance of the site running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Please [file bugs](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/issues/new) if something went wrong!

**Note**: If you get a `TypeError: unhashable type` page when loading `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, it means you've forgotten one of two (or both!) of the bare minimum config.py requirements:

* A non-production [`ISSUES_REPO_URI`](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/blob/master/config.py.example#L57) e.g., `miketaylr/nobody-look-at-this/issues`
* [`BOT_OAUTH_TOKEN`](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/blob/master/config.py.example#L64)

**Note**: If you get a 404 at GitHub when clicking "Login", it means you haven't [filled in the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` or `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/blob/master/config.py.example#L47-L49).

You can ignore `TOKEN_MAP`â€”it's implemented in such a way to always fall back to the `BOT_OAUTH_TOKEN` token.

## Running Tests

You can run tests from the project root with the `nosetests` command.

### Functional Tests

We use [Intern](http://theintern.io/) to run functional tests.

To run them, make sure you download the Selenium standalone server from the repo root:

``` bash
wget http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/2.42/selenium-server-standalone-2.42.2.jar
```

The `firefox` binary will also need to be in your `PATH`. Here's how this can be done on OS X:

``` bash
export PATH="/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/:$PATH"
```

Start the Selenium and application servers (in separate terminal tabs or windows):

``` bash
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.42.2.jar
source env/bin/activate && python run.py
```

And to run the tests (in a new tab or terminal window):

``` bash
node_modules/.bin/intern-runner config=tests/functional/intern
```

Many tests require the ability to log in with GitHub OAuth. This is achieved by passing in a GitHub username: `user` and password: `pw` as command-line arguments:

``` bash
node_modules/.bin/intern-runner config=tests/functional/intern user=testusername pw=testpassword
```
