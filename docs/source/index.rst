What about Web Compatibility?
-----------------------------

An individual person, when using or creating on the Web, should have the freedom of choice of their browsers. It is then expected that their experience is not limited to one or two products. Sites they visit should work.

`webcompat.com <http://webcompat.com/>`_ is a collaborative Web site for helping everyone to report bugs about Web sites for any browsers. Once the bug has been reported, it is tested, analyzed and eventually the site owners are contacted for encouraging them to fix it.
