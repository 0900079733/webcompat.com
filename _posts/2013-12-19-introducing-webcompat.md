_A person should be able to use the Web in all browsers and devices_.

Web Compatibility issues are related to Web sites implementing techniques that create issues for a certain class of browsers and/or devices. As a result, individuals will not be able to use a [Web site according to their own choices][escalator].

These issues are cross-platform, cross-product and related to the Web as a whole. There are circumstances when companies choose to use a standardized techniques which is not available for an older browser, but that should be mitigated by making the Web site usable under any circumstances. So if a person is using the last version of [Firefox][firefox] or a vocal browser such as [Jaws][jaws], or a proxy browser such as [Opera Mini][mini] or [UCWeb][ucweb], the Web site should be able to work.

Mozilla has two areas for dealing with Web Compatibility issues. The goal is to make the Web usable by anyone&mdash;not just Firefox users, but we will focus the efforts on solving issues for Firefox users.

### Desktop Web Compatibility

The Desktop Web Compatibility effort is at this time mostly driven by volunteers. There are no specific Mozilla resources allocated on it. You are more than welcome to contribute and help solving the issues by contacting Web sites.

### Mobile Web Compatibility

The [Mobile Web Compatibility][mobile-compat] effort focuses on solving Web Compatibility issues with Firefox for Android and FirefoxOS. Mozilla can't fix the Web alone, so you are welcome to participate with us.
